# Task Board: Third-Party APIs Challenge

## Description

My motivation for creating this task board was to create a place that i can add and keep track of different tasks that need to be completed. I wanted to be able to keep track of tasks by date they were due and by the status of the task so I could have help keeping on top of different things I want to accomplish. This solved the problem of needing to find a different location that would allow me to keep track of tasks. This also allows me to keep track of task details that are most important to me. The biggest thing I learned from this project was the drag and drop feature. There are so many things that can be done with the drag and drop ability.

## Usage

Just below the header of the website, there is a green "Add Task" button. When you click that button, you are presented with a pop-up box that has 3 fields for the user to fill out. The first field is for the user to add a title to their task card. The second field has a pop up for selecting the due date. The third field is for the user to add a description of the task they want to create a card for. Once all three fields are filled in, the user can select the "Submit" button. Once that is clicked, the task card will get added to the task board. All newly created tasks will be added to the "To Do" column. The user can then move the task cards back and fourth between the 3 colums: "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done". There are three possible colors for the cards - Red, yellow, and white. A card turns red when the due date is past the current date. A card turns yellow if the due date is less that 24 hours away. The card is white if the previous two situations aren't applicable. Once a card is put into the "Done" column, the card will turn white.
